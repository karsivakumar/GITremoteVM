npm install gulp -gulp                  --> install gulp globally 
npm -v gulp     or      gulp -v         --> version of gulp installed
npm init                                --> creates a package.json file which initializes gulp and adds all the necessary content

npm install                             --> digs through package.json file and install all the dependencies in the project from node package manager,
                                            even if you delete the node_modules command, running the npm install command automatically installs them again
                                            
gulp.task                               --> runs the gulp task that is associated with the gulp code that is in gulpfile.js
                                            The syntax would be <gulpvar>.task('<taskvar>',<function()>);
                                            
gulp taskname                           --> Call the gulp task created above from commandline  by runningthe command "gulp <taskvar>".

<gulptaskname>.src(folderpath)          --> takes in the source from a folder and passes to the next step in the function

<gulptaskname>.dest(folderpath)         --> takes in the data from the previous step and passes to a folder

var <gulptaskname> = require('gulp');       --> needed to run gulp
var <gulpname> = require('gulp-uglify');    --> needed to run uglify


----------------------

differences from the course material

1. after Version 4.0 gulp tasks do not autocomplete by themselves, completion
has to be explicitly signaled from the task, usually done with a promise

2. after version 4.0 gulp watch no longer accepts task names explicitly, but
only functions as <gulpvarname>.series(taskname)
