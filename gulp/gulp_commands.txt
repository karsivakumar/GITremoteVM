npm install gulp -gulp                  --> install gulp globally 
npm -v gulp     or      gulp -v         --> version of gulp installed
npm init                                --> creates a package.json file which initializes gulp and adds all the necessary content

npm install                             --> digs through package.json file and install all the dependencies in the project from node package manager,

gulp.task                               --> runs the gulp task that is associated with the gulp code that is in gulpfile.js
                                            The syntax would be <gulpvar>.task('<taskvar>',<function()>);
